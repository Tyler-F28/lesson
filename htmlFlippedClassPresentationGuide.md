## üß± Deliverables

### 1. **MARP Slide Deck**
Create a `.md` file using Marp syntax (you may name it `teamX_lessonY.md`).

I will provide a template.

Example header:
```markdown
marp: true
theme: uncover
paginate: true
class: invert
````

Your deck should include:

* ‚úÖ Title slide with lesson number, topic, and team members
* ‚úÖ 10‚Äì15 content slides summarizing the key concepts
* ‚úÖ Code blocks and examples from the lesson
* ‚úÖ **Interwoven class questions** (use 1‚Äì2 per section, e.g. ‚ÄúWhat does `<thead>` mean?‚Äù)
* ‚úÖ A few slides for **live coding or class activity ideas**

---

### 2. **Quiz Questions**

Write **5 multiple-choice questions** (MCQs) based on your lesson content.

Each question should include:

* 1 correct answer
* 3 distractors (plausible wrong answers)
* An answer key at the end

**Example Format:**

```markdown
**Question 1:**  
Which element defines the main visible content of an HTML document?  
A) <header>  
B) <main>  
C) <section>  
D) <body>

‚úÖ **Answer:** D) <body>
```

### 3. **Team Presentation**

Each student must present their section of the slide deck:

* Student 1: Introduction & foundational concepts
* Student 2: Code examples and demonstrations
* Student 3: Class engagement + quiz preview

**Presentation Length:** ~10 minutes per team
**Tools:** Marp preview in VS Code or exported PDF slides

---

## üí° Tips for Success

* Simplify long paragraphs into **visuals, bullets, or examples**
* Use **code blocks** to show examples (triple backticks with `html`)
* Use **horizontal rules (`---`)** to separate slides
* Include 1‚Äì2 **questions per concept** to engage classmates
* Highlight important tags, attributes, or best practices
* End with a **summary and reflection question**

---

## üì¶ Submission

* Upload your `.md` file and quiz file to Google Classroom
* Label them clearly:
